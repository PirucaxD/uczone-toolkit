---lib/farm.lua - stateless farming geometry + cast-worthiness policy.
---
---Hero-agnostic. Every function takes explicit inputs (a world origin and a
---caller-supplied list of units); NONE of them call the engine API. The hero
---script owns the actual creep/neutral enumeration (which engine calls vary by
---framework version) and passes a plain unit list in. That keeps this module
---pure math: fully testable, zero runtime-API risk, reusable by any hero with
---an AoE / line nuke (Lina Dragon Slave, Jakiro Macropyre, etc.).
---
---v0.5.78: created for Lina's HOLD wave-clear (mana + stack aware). The
---line/point AoE-count optimizers are general enough that offensive W/Q aim
---could later consume them too; left here under "farm" for cohesion with the
---WorthCasting policy. Could lift the pure optimizers to lib/geometry.lua if a
---second non-farm consumer appears.
---
---Unit list contract (each entry):
---  { pos = <Vector>, hp = <number?>, is_neutral = <boolean?>, entity = <any?> }
---Only `pos` (with .x / .y) is required. `hp` is used as a tie-break weight.
