---ChannelGate - "is starting a channel here safe from channel-breaking disables?"
---
---Tinker is the first
---hero with long self-channels (Rearm 1.2-2.7s, Keen 2.93s). A channel started within a
---disabler's cast range is a guaranteed loss: the stun breaks it with the mana spent
---(channels break on stuns/hexes/forced movement - NOT on attack damage), and the
---lane_unsafe 1v1-trade rule correctly stays to FARM against a lone laner, so it can
---never gate channel starts. This module supplies the missing kit-awareness: the static
---half of "don't channel near a ready disabler". (The READINESS half - last-seen-cast
---stamps fed from modifier events - arrived with ARC E2: Stamp/ReadyAt below; unstamped
---abilities still assume ready, the conservative default.)
---
---Pure over the three data tables (no engine reads, no state): the caller passes a
---hero_data abilities list + the ability_data and threat_data MODULES and caches the
---result per hero name.
