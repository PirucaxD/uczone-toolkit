---lib/defense.lua - generic Layer-2 save dispatcher (Tier-2 extraction).
---
---Pulls the chain-resolution + chain-walk + throttle bookkeeping out of the
---per-hero defense layer. The DATA (chain tables, SAVE_FIRE map, override
---tables, filter sets) stays hero-side; the ALGORITHM lives here. Each hero
---calls Defense.New{cfg} once at init and keeps thin adapters around the
---returned dispatcher.
---
---No cross-hero state. Each dispatcher captures one cfg and operates only on
---the throttle_state / armed_threats refs the hero passes in.
---
---Audit-trail of equivalence vs the pre-extraction inline path:
---  - ResolveSaveOrder mirrors Lina pre-v0.5.0 resolve_save_order (anim ->
---    hero -> patched_recommended -> category -> default; first hit wins).
---  - TrySaveSelf mirrors the chain walk: same skip reasons, same order,
---    same reserve-penalty + concurrent-threat math, same tlog event names
---    so log greps keep working unchanged.
---  - CanFire / MarkFired match the inline LAYER2_REACTION_WINDOW gate.
---
---v0.5.40 TIER 0 (dispatcher unification):
---  - Dispatcher.in_flight_locks / in_flight_locks_ally: per-threat lock map
---    keyed [target_idx][canonical_mod][caster_idx]. Enforces the v0.5.7 E13
---    single-save-per-engagement invariant structurally; replaces the
---    Dedup.threat_already_responded 2.0s window that misses slow-travel
---    threats (Bara WW+Pike, Sniper Assassinate D-key double-fire).
---  - TryAcquireLock / ReleaseLock / ForceNextDispatch: identity-by-handle
---    lock primitives. Lock key tuple (target_idx, canonical_mod, caster_idx)
---    distinguishes casters per v0.5.14 BL-A5/BL-B7 (two casters arming the
---    same modifier are two concurrent threats).
---  - Dispatch / DispatchAlly: new top-level entries that wrap chain-walk in
---    a lock-acquire / on-success-hold cycle. Self-domain and ally-domain
---    locks live in separate maps (Lotus-on-self does NOT block Glimmer-on-
---    ally for the same threat).
---  - TrySaveSelf is now a thin compat wrapper around Dispatch for existing
---    Lina call sites; the Routing phase migrates direct callers.
---  - ResolveSaveOrder gains an optional ctx table for GAP-3 (FC chain
---    demotion under fs_shard_window). Hero populates ctx; lib reads it.
---  - cfg.canonicalize_mod (mod -> string) and cfg.eta_resolver
---    (canonical_mod -> resolver_fn) are new hero-supplied accessors. Both
---    optional; absence falls through to behavioural-neutral defaults
---    (identity canonicalization, 2.0s fallback lock TTL).

-- v0.5.110 CHAIN COMPOSITION (Lina/CHAIN_COMPOSITION_DESIGN.md)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Compose a final save chain from a lib item backbone + hero ability
---injections + hero item exclusions. PURE: no engine calls, no dispatcher
---state, safe at hero load time. Used TWO ways: automatically by
---ResolveSaveOrder tier 3 for category-resolved threats, and directly by
---heroes to build bespoke chains at load (e.g. Lina's committed-attacker
---variants). NEVER mutates item_chain (it is typically the shared
---TD.CATEGORY_CHAINS entry); always returns a new table.
---
---Algorithm (design sec 3.1):
---  1. filtered = item_chain minus any name in exclusions.
---  2. each injection, in declared order, splices injection.save at anchor:
---     "head" -> position 1; "tail" -> append; {before="X"} -> immediately
---     before the first X; {after="X"} -> immediately after the first X;
---     before/after target absent (or anchor nil/unrecognized) -> tail. The
---     save is ALWAYS placed, never dropped.
---  3. dedupe, first occurrence wins. An injected save already in the
---     backbone therefore MOVES to its anchor when anchored earlier (the
---     committed-ranged cyclone-to-head case relies on this).
---@param item_chain string[]|nil  category item backbone
---@param injections table[]|nil   list of { save = string, anchor = "head"|"tail"|{before=string}|{after=string} }
---@param exclusions table<string, boolean>|nil  item names removed from the backbone

---Create a dispatcher bound to one hero's defense config.
---@param cfg table see Lina/LIB_DEFENSE_EXTRACTION.md for the cfg field list
---  v0.5.40 TIER 0 additions (all optional, backward-compatible):
---    cfg.canonicalize_mod   fun(mod:string|nil):string|nil
---        Hero-supplied alias collapser. Maps modifier_pudge_dismember_pull and
---        modifier_pudge_dismember to one canonical string. nil/missing means
---        identity (the mod string IS the canonical key).
---    cfg.eta_resolver       table<string, fun(caster, target, armed_entry, ability_handle, now_t):number>
---        Map canonical_mod -> resolver_fn returning seconds_until_resolution
---        (>=0). Missing entry triggers cfg.eta_resolver_default; missing both
---        triggers fallback_lock_ttl_s.
---    cfg.eta_resolver_default fun(caster, target, armed_entry, ability_handle, now_t):number
---        Fallback resolver for any canonical_mod not in cfg.eta_resolver.
---    cfg.lock_buffer_s      number  (default 0.3)
---        Buffer added to resolver eta before the lock expiry timestamp.
---        Covers cfg.reaction_window throttle (~0.1) + engine apply slack
---        (~0.2). See design lock_ttl_math note.
---    cfg.fallback_lock_ttl_s number  (default 2.0)
---        Used when neither eta_resolver[mod] nor eta_resolver_default
---        produces a value. Matches legacy Dedup.THREAT_WINDOW.
---    cfg.ability_handle     fun(ability_name:string|nil):any|nil
---        Optional. Returns the engine ability handle for an ability_name so
---        resolvers can read GetCastPoint / GetChannelTime live. nil-tolerant.
---    cfg.post_pick_filter   fun(picked:table, ctx:table|nil, threat_mod:string|nil, authoritative:boolean):table?, boolean?
---        v0.5.41 GAP-3-GENERIC. Optional chain-rewrite hook called by
---        ResolveSaveOrder after chain resolution, before returning. Receives
---        the resolved (picked, ctx, threat_mod, authoritative); may return a
---        new (picked, authoritative) tuple to substitute. Return nil for
---        picked to keep the resolved chain. Lib applies new_auth only when
---        non-nil so a hook returning just a new chain preserves the
---        original authoritative flag. nil hook = passthrough.
---  v0.5.53 Phase 3 slice 3 additions (all optional, opt-in):
---    cfg.threat_catalog     table|nil
---        Map threat_mod -> catalog entry (kind / speed_source / catch_radius
---        / etc.). When registered AND cfg.compute_arrival_time is registered,
---        run_chain_walk applies a per-save catalog gate before firing each
---        save with cfg.save_fire[name].prep_time > 0. Hero passes the same
---        THREAT_ARRIVAL_TIMING table its own compute_arrival_time consumes.
---        nil = no lib-side catalog gate (Sniper today; legacy behavior).
---    cfg.compute_arrival_time fun(threat_mod:string, caster:any, target:any):number?, any, table?, number?
---        Returns (impact_t, impact_pos, cat_entry, eff_speed). Used by the
---        per-save catalog gate to compute fire windows. Same signature as
---        Lina's state.compute_arrival_time. nil = no lib-side catalog gate.
---    cfg.self_npc           fun():any|nil
---        Returns the hero's own NPC handle (used as the catalog target).
---        Already used by TrySaveSelf; now also consumed by the per-save
---        catalog gate in run_chain_walk.
---  v0.5.110 chain-composition additions (all optional, opt-in; spec
---  Lina/CHAIN_COMPOSITION_DESIGN.md):
---    cfg.ability_injections table[]|nil
---        List of { save = string, categories = string[]|"*", anchor =
---        "head"|"tail"|{before=string}|{after=string} }. When this OR
---        cfg.exclusions is registered, ResolveSaveOrder gains tier 3:
---        any threat resolving to a category (TD.CategoryOf(threat_mod)
---        or category_hint) gets Defense.ComposeChain(raw
---        TD.CATEGORY_CHAINS backbone, matching injections,
---        exclusions[category]) as an AUTHORITATIVE chain, ahead of
---        patched_recommended / category_chains. MUST stay static after
---        Defense.New: composed chains memoize per category.
---    cfg.exclusions         table<string, table<string, boolean>>|nil
---        Map category -> { item_name = true }: items removed from that
---        category's composed backbone. Same static-after-load rule.
---  v0.5.127 CD-aware lock release additions (all optional, opt-in; general
---  re-engage structure, NOT tied to the full fixed TTL):
---    cfg.item_on_cd         fun(save_short:string):boolean|nil
---        Returns true if the named save's item/ability is currently on
---        cooldown (= it actually fired / was spent). When registered, a HELD
---        lock is released early on a re-engage dispatch once its fired save is
---        confirmed spent, so the chain advances to the NEXT ready save (e.g.
---        Pike spent -> WW) instead of staying locked for the whole TTL.
---        nil = no early release (Sniper); the lock holds for its resolved TTL
---        exactly as v0.5.40. The lib pcall-wraps it; a throw keeps the lock.
---    cfg.lock_cd_coalesce_s number  (default 0.30)
---        Minimum hold before ANY CD-aware release. Coalesces a single threat
---        instance's multiple dispatch paths (anim + modcreate + armed, all
---        within a few frames) into ONE save so the single-spend invariant
---        survives. A new dispatch past this floor is treated as a re-engage.
---    cfg.lock_cd_giveup_s   number  (default 0.60)
---        If the fired save never enters cooldown by this point (the issue did
---        not take, or a no-cooldown save), release anyway so the chain can
---        re-attempt rather than waiting out the full TTL.

-- per the v0.5.74 lib-first audit. Each is pure data + engine calls; building
-- the resolver table is then just `EtaR.CastPoint(0.5)`, `EtaR.Remaining(

-- once it migrates to a Defense-cfg dispatcher.
