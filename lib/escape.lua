---lib/escape.lua - danger-aware escape destination picking.
---
---Hero-agnostic. All functions take entity / vector args explicitly
---(no implicit hero-state reads), matching the lib/geometry.lua
---convention.
---
---Extracted from Sniper.lua during Lina Phase 5 (positioning
---intelligence for self-displacement saves). The three helpers form
---a small module:
---  - Escape.DangerAtPos(me, pos)
---  - Escape.SafePushDestination(me, dest, threat_hint)
---  - Escape.PickDir(me, me_pos, toward, push, threat_hint, filter?)
---
---Sniper.lua reaches them via thin state.* wrappers so its existing
---call sites do not change. Lina.lua's Phase 5 .fire bodies (Pike
---first, then Force / EUL / WW) call them directly.
---
---No engine API surprises beyond the two already-documented gotchas:
---  - NPC.FindRotationAngle returns RADIANS (math.deg before any
---    deg-based compare). NOT used inside this module - the angle
---    math is in the callers' turn-then-fire harness.
---  - First cast of a freshly-acquired item silently dropped. Also
---    a caller concern (Sniper's pike_prime + Lina's pike_reissue).
---
---v0.5.61 fix: require lib/target here. The original v0.5.57 extraction
---left Target as a global ref expecting it to be available in the lib's
---scope, but lib modules do not inherit the hero script's upvalues.
---Latent bug bit EUL on first self-cast (v0.5.60 demo log L2712:
---'attempt to index a nil value (global Target)' inside
---Escape.SafePushDestination). The Pike / Force code path would have
---crashed identically; v0.5.58 demo never triggered Pike's self-cast
---branch (all Pike fires went enemy-target via the unchanged primary
---branch) so it stayed latent.
---
---v0.5.75 lift (lib-first audit bucket B + C + D): three more helpers
---moved out of Lina.lua into this module so future heroes (Sniper next)
---pick them up via require with zero rewrite:
---  - Escape.ComputeSafeDest (stateless): toward = caster-or-centroid,
---    then PickDir. Returns (escape_dir, landing) or (nil, nil).
---  - Escape.TrySelfPush + Escape.SelfPushTick: the turn-then-fire
---    harness Pike + Force self-cast both use. Stateful via a caller-
---    owned pending struct (return-the-pending pattern, matches v0.5.74's
---    ThreatData.ComputeArrivalTime closure shape: lib stays stateless,
---    hero owns the slot + ticks once per frame).
---  - Escape.QueueSafePostMove + Escape.PostAirborneMoveTick: the
---    re-issue-while-airborne harness EUL + WW use to walk Lina toward
---    a danger-aware landing during / after airborne. Same return-the-
---    pending shape.
---
---All five stateful entry points take a cfg table with hero-side
---callbacks (safe_issue, issue_item_self, tlog, now, uname, item_get,
---item_ready, on_self_cast) so the lib never imports a hero's wrappers
---directly. cfg shape documented above each function. Sniper migration
---is a separate slice (replace state.compute_safe_dest / pick_escape_dir
---/ pending_pike_self / pending_pike_self_tick call sites with Escape.*
---calls passing his own cfg); Sniper.lua is intentionally untouched in
---v0.5.75.

-- VISION section (v0.1.399 consolidation phase 3: lib/vision.lua absorbed;
-- the LAST of the lib merges and the only THREE-HERO
-- file). Mounted as Escape.Vision below, ABOVE every use (Vision.Age in
-- FogSnapshot) - a definition below its caller resolves as a nil global at
-- runtime, the class that broke v0.1.397. ONE DELIBERATE EDIT vs the absorbed
-- file, mandated by the phase-3 review: module state lives in an ANCHORED
-- STORE (package.loaded pseudo-key; see the store block below for why NOT
-- _G), not in section locals. Tinker.lua AND Lina.lua both cache-clear
-- lib.escape at load, so per-instance locals would fork an EMPTY tracker per
-- hero - only the last-wired instance would stamp, and the other heroes would
-- read eternally-empty fog ages with every gate green. find-or-create once;
-- every re-require aliases the SAME tables.
-- ============================================================================

---(absorbed lib/vision.lua) - shared last-seen tracker for HEROES.
---
---WHY THIS EXISTS: `Hero.GetLastVisibleTime` is DEAD - measured nil on 405 of 405 fogged
---reads across all five enemy heroes in one 895s match (Tinker g353, Umbrella build 831).
---The method exists and is documented nilable; it simply never yields a value, so every
---fog-age model built on it is inert (FogSnapshot below, lib/target.lua). No
---other API returns a last-seen timestamp - `FogOfWar.IsPointVisible` answers "is this
---POINT visible now", not "when did I last see this hero" - so the timestamp has to be
---built.
---
---THIS TRACKER OWNS ITS CLOCK. Callers never pass one for age math: the stamp and the read
---both come from `clock()` below. That is not stylistic. A caller-supplied clock is exactly
---the defect that made the preceding fog arc a red herring - Tinker injected
---`GameRules.GetDOTATime` into a subtraction against an engine-clock timestamp, so `age`
---went negative and clamped to 0 for 275+ versions. Owning the clock makes that class of
---bug structurally impossible here.
---
---SINGLETON: the STORE below is the singleton, not the module. A Lua module is only a
---singleton while it stays in package.loaded, and two heroes cache-clear lib.escape at
---every load - so the shared state is anchored under a package.loaded pseudo-key and
---survives any re-require; stamps are written once and read by every hero in the same Lua
---state. KNOWN CEILING: the store also survives ACROSS matches in one client session, so
---a recycled entity handle can inherit a stale stamp (a LARGE age). Per consumer that
---cuts BOTH WAYS: FogProximityRisk SKIPS an enemy aged past its cap (LESS caution), while
---AdvanceRiskScore keeps a huge probable disc in reach and inflates the fog score (MORE
---caution for Lina's FC gates). Pre-merge, each script load began with an empty tracker.

-- the anchored store (find-or-create ONCE). THE ANCHOR IS package.loaded UNDER A
-- PSEUDO-MODULE KEY, NOT _G: UCZone's sandbox does not expose _G (lib/signal.lua's
-- v6.15.3 hotfix note - "attempt to index a nil value (global '_G')" MEASURED at module
-- load), so a rawget(_G, ...) here would crash all three heroes at load. package.loaded
-- is proven in-engine on every axis this needs: shared across hero scripts in one Lua
-- state (lib/signal.lua's registry rests on exactly that), writable (every hero's
-- cache-clear list assigns into it at every load), and never cleared at THIS key (the
-- clear lists are explicit lib.* name lists; nothing requires or nils a pseudo-key).
-- If package.loaded is somehow absent, fall back to a module-local store: per-instance
-- state = the pre-merge per-load behaviour, a safe valve, never a crash.

---Shared self-push harness used by Pike + Force self-cast saves.
---Computes a danger-aware destination and either:
---  - fires the item immediately (Lina already facing within 30 deg of
---    the escape direction) and returns (nil, ok) - no pending to stash
---  - turns toward away_pt then arms a pending struct the caller stores
---    and feeds to Escape.SelfPushTick each frame. Returns (pending, ok)
---    where ok is the result of the turn MOVE issue.
---
---The 30 deg gate is on facing angle, not landing distance. NPC.FindRot-
---ationAngle returns RADIANS (see reference_uczone_api_gotchas); math.deg
---before the gate.
---
---Pike-specific behaviour (item_name == "item_hurricane_pike"): when
---cfg.on_self_cast is provided it fires right after a successful issue,
---so heroes that need the first-cast-drop pike_reissue stamp can install
---it without the lib knowing about Pike internals.

-- v0.5.76: PIKE-ADVANCE RISK ANALYSIS (offensive counterpart to ComputeSafeDest)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
---ComputeSafeDest answers "where should I escape TO" (away from threat).
---ComputeAdvanceDest answers the inverse: "is it safe to push TOWARD this
---enemy, and where do I land if I do". Built for Pike self-cast offensive
---use (push 600u along facing-toward-target) but the geometry helper is
---reusable for any directional push (Force Staff offensive, etc).
---
---Risk includes BOTH visible enemies near the landing AND fog enemies whose
---probable-position cone (last-known-pos + max travel since last seen)
---overlaps the landing. The fog component answers the user's specific ask:
---"check up for possible heroes on the fog might be on PI last seen
---enemies". Uses Hero.GetLastMaphackPos + Hero.GetLastVisibleTime per
---API_GOTCHAS: nil GetLastVisibleTime means never-fogged (fresh visible),
---treated as age=0.

---Max enemy move speed cap for fog probable-radius growth. 700 = generous
---ceiling for any hero with movement items / talents / haste. Going much
---higher just makes the cone meaningless (after 10s any fog enemy could be
---"anywhere within 7000u" which scores every landing identically). 30s cap
---on age keeps the radius bounded even for very-stale-fog enemies.
local PROBE_MAX_MS = 700
local PROBE_MAX_AGE_S = 30

---v0.5.77: shared per-call snapshot of ALL enemy heroes (visible + fog).
---Extracted from NearbyEnemiesIncludingFog so multiple consumers (Pike-
---advance risk, gank-inbound check, rotation tracker, initiator probe,
---safest-spot grid picker) reuse one scan instead of each running their
---own. Callers can pass opts.snapshot to consumer functions to share a
---snapshot across calls within a frame.
---
---For visible enemies: pos = Entity.GetAbsOrigin (true current), age = 0,
---probable_radius = 0, visible = true.
---
---For fog enemies: pos = Hero.GetLastMaphackPos (last known), age =
---now - Hero.GetLastVisibleTime (clamped to [0, 30s]), probable_radius =
---age * max_ms (700 cap), visible = false. last_pos_known = false when
---Hero.GetLastMaphackPos returns nil (never-seen hero; the entry is
---excluded since we have no position to reason about).
---
---API gotcha (per API_GOTCHAS): Hero.GetLastVisibleTime returns nil for
---never-fogged heroes (demo bots, freshly spawned). nil is NOT a veto;
---treated as age = 0 "fresh visible".
---
---Dormant check: Entity.IsDormant(e) is the canonical "currently not
---visible to our team" predicate. Falls back to "no entry in
---Heroes.InRadius's omitDormant=true scan" if Entity.IsDormant absent.

---Commit-risk exposure -> a radius WIDENING distance, in units.

---distance, no move-speed divisor and no division at all in here: that is
---what keeps 0/0, inf and NaN out of the result at the source.
---approach_speed <= 0 returns 0 = the documented no-code-edit kill switch,
---and the <= (not ==) is the guard that matters: a NEGATIVE speed without it
---yields a negative widen, which SHRINKS every danger radius and makes the
---bot blind rather than cautious, silently and exactly backwards.
---The clamp is math.min(cap, math.max(0, w)) IN THAT ORDER. Measured on the
---deployed Lua 5.4: math.max(0, nan) = 0 while math.min(cap, nan) = cap, so
---this ordering sends a NaN to 0 (today's behaviour) rather than to the
---maximum widening. The reverse order returns cap.

---  cap is sanitised to 0: the clamp order defends the exposure argument only,

---  the SAME "blind rather than cautious" failure as a negative speed arriving
---  through the other parameter (a negative widen SHRINKS the danger radius;
---  a NaN one makes `edge < r_eff` false for every enemy at every distance, so
